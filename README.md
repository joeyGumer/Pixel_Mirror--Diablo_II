# Pixel Mirror - Diablo II: Blood Harvest 

**Diablo II: Blood Harvest 1.0**

Diablo II: Blood Harvest is an ARPG game influenced by the Rogue-lite genre and based on Diablo II, made by Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.

In this game you take the role of a vampire with unique skills, divided in three different types:
Martial Blood, Blood Spells and Night Summoning. Depending on the strategy that you choose to follow, you will obtain different powers to face dangerous enemies.

You will have to explore different levels in which your objective is to defeat the monsters in your way.
Each time you play the game these enemies will appear in new places, so each game will be a unique experience.
Keep in mind that there are items around the maps that will upgrade your attributes, so don’t forget to equip them.

Each map has a final boss that you will have to defeat in order to continue with the game.
The bosses have different strategies and you will have to find diverse ways to face each boss.
